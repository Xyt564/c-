# c-
this repo is a personal collection of C++ programs and practice files. This repo serves as both a backup for my work and a resource for anyone who wants to explore, learn, or reuse C++ code. The files range from simple exercises to more complex examples, with the goal of sharing knowledge and encouraging collaboration.
