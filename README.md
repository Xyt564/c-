# 🧠 C++ Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of **C++ programs and practice files**!
This repository serves two main purposes:

1. **Backup** – Keeping my C++ work safe and organized.
2. **Learning & Sharing** – Providing examples for anyone who wants to explore, learn, or reuse C++ code.

## 📌 Notes

* This repo is a **work-in-progress** as I continue learning C++.
* Some files are **practice snippets**, while others are **complete projects**.
* Suggestions and feedback are welcome!
* Additionally, these projects are **not actively maintained** and may get outdated. I will likely post more recent code as I continue developing new projects.
