## 🛡️ Security Policy

This repository contains **C++ practice projects and small programs**. While the code is intended for learning and experimentation, it’s important to be aware of potential security considerations when running or modifying the code.

---

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

* The code is **for educational purposes only**.
* Do **not use these programs in production environments** without proper review.
* Some programs (e.g., those using input from users or files) **may not include full input validation or error handling**. Be cautious when running them on untrusted input.
* Avoid running compiled binaries from unknown sources. Always **review the source code before executing**.

## 📝 Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a potential **security issue** or vulnerability in any project in this repository:

1. Please **open an Issue** on this repository with the details.

2. Include:

   * A description of the vulnerability
   * Steps to reproduce
   * Suggested mitigation (if applicable)

3. Do **not** publicly disclose the issue until it has been addressed.

## 🔐 Safe Practices

* Always compile code yourself from the source files.
* Avoid executing programs that require elevated privileges unless you understand the risks.
* Keep your development environment updated to reduce risk from external vulnerabilities.
