# ðŸ“š C++ Tutorials Collection

Welcome to the **C++ Tutorials** folder! This collection contains over 30 individual C++ programs, each focusing on a fundamental concept or feature of the language. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on specific topics, these examples are designed to help you understand and practice core C++ programming techniques.

## ðŸ§­ Folder Structure

Each file in this folder demonstrates a specific C++ concept. Here's a brief overview of the types of topics covered:

* **Control Flow**: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `while`, `for`, `do-while`
* **Data Types & Variables**: `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`, `string`
* **Functions**: Declaration, definition, and usage
* **Arrays & Loops**: Iteration techniques and array manipulation
* **Input/Output**: `cin`, `cout`, file handling basics
* **Miscellaneous**: Basic algorithms, simple games, and more

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use This Collection

1. **Clone or Download**:
   Clone this repository or download the `tutorials` folder to your local machine.

   **by running**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Xyt564/cpp-projects.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Folder**:
   Open the `tutorials` folder to find individual `.cpp` files.

4. **Compile and Run**:
   For each `.cpp` file:

   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o filename
   ./filename
   ```

   Replace `filename` with the actual name of the file you're working with.

5. **Explore and Learn**:
   Open each file to see the code and read any comments or instructions provided. Modify the code to experiment and deepen your understanding.

## ðŸ“Œ Example Files

Here are a few examples of what you'll find:

* **01\_if\_statement.cpp**: Demonstrates the use of `if` statements for conditional logic.
* **02\_switch\_case.cpp**: Shows how to implement a `switch` statement for multiple conditions.
* **03\_for\_loop.cpp**: Illustrates the use of `for` loops for iteration.
* **04\_array\_example.cpp**: Provides examples of array initialization and access.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Learning

* **Start from the Beginning**: Begin with the first file and work your way through the examples to build a solid foundation.
* **Experiment**: Modify the code in each file to see how changes affect the program's behavior.
* **Ask Questions**: If you're unsure about a concept, seek clarification through online resources or communities.
